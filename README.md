## Project 4 Assignment

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to obtain greater understanding of NCAA Division 1 Statistics using Machine Learning. Can we determine championship winners based on statistics?
  
### Datasets Analyzed 
   * The main dataset used was several data pulls of team stats going back 10 to 20 years, and included such stats as Assist/Turnover Ratio, Three-Point Attempst, and Rebounds. These were all pulled from the stats page of the NCAA website and combined into one main csv file using Spark. The combined data then includes Team Name, Season of the Stats in format of 1011 for example, meaning years 2010 through 2011. Overall, about 3700 records combined to analyze.
