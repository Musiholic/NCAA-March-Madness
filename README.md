# NCAA-March-Madness

## Project 4 Assignment

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to obtain greater understanding of NCAA Division 1 Statistics using Machine Learning. Can we determine championship winners based on statistics?
  
### Datasets Analyzed 
   * The main dataset used was several data pulls of team stats going back 10 to 20 years, and included such stats as Assist/Turnover Ratio, Three-Point Attempts, and Rebounds. These were all pulled from the stats page of the NCAA website and combined into one main csv file using Spark. The combined data then includes Team Name, Season of the Stats in format of 1011 for example, meaning years 2010 through 2011. Overall, about 3700 records combined to analyze.

Requirements
#Data Model Implementation.
-A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model.

-The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling.

-The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark.

-The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared.

#Data Model Optimization (25 points)
-The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself.

-Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script.

#GitHub Documentation
-GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use.

-The README is customized as a polished presentation of the content of the project.

#Group Presentation
-All group members speak during the presentation.

-Content, transitions, and conclusions flow smoothly within any time restrictions.

-The content is relevant to the project.

-The presentation maintains audience interest.
